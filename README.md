# Hello GitHub
This is my first repository on GITHUB.
Up to now, I have spent much time on Java Programing.
Then I write a game-Tetris.
And I am sure that I have a deep understanding on both on Java and object-oriented programming.

Next, I will begin to study machine learning, and I am happy to discuss you, welcoming to contact me.
